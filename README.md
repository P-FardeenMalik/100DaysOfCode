# 100DaysOfCode

I am taking 100 days of coding challenge from 1st Feb 2024. In this challenge I will spend my time atleast 4hr in building projects from scratch. My main motivation behind taking #100DaysOfCode is to increase my consistency. I will give my best efforts to complete this challenge without any breaks in case sickness of any other valid reason , I will add 2 extra days to the challenge for each day I've missed. Feel fee to give any suggestions you have for me. All suggestions are welcome.
